# React Starter

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

And then, a bunch of other üí© happened:

- [![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
- [![Code Style](https://badgen.net/badge/code%20style/airbnb/ff5a5f?icon=airbnb)](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). I have adjusted this slightly as per [this `commit`](https://github.com/manavm1990/node-starter/commit/ff1ed419d3ed411683b404b1cc6e221c859b0d33). More may be forthcoming as _feedback and [PRs](https://github.com/swic-cis-177/mt-project-studentloganbutler/pulls) trickle in._
- [`husky`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) is also there to help check over code quality with the linters b4 there is a successful `commit`.
- Various VS Code 'settings' and 'extensions.' Look in the bottom right when you open this up in VS Code to install them.
- [Kite ü™Å](https://www.kite.com/javascript/) is also included. I personally recommend it, but it's certainly not compulsory to set this up.
- Directories üìÇ with 'index.js' files as a suggested architecture. See comments in those files for addl. info.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
- [Styled Components with Stylelint](https://github.com/styled-components/stylelint-processor-styled-components) I have also included the recommendations listed [here](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- [TypographyJS](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/) is included, but no theme. To add a Typography theme, check [this post](https://dev.to/codefinity/typography-in-a-cra-5aoa).
- Probably some other stuff that I am currently 4getting about

## `npm start`

Assuming that you already did `npm i`
